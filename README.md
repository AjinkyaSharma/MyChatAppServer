# MyChatAppServer
SampleChatApp with Socket.io

This server is written in Node.js using Socket.io.
We use Harper DB for storing the chat messages.
For now the server just joins a user in the channel and allows to send and receive messages. 
But we can add more features like - typing users, currently online users etc.
